# AutoRemote Message Action
A simple FlowCard Action for Homey users to send a textmessage to a device through AutoRemote/Tasker.

With this tool you can easily send text messages to AutoRemote/Tasker by just providing the message body, the device Key and the Password for sending the message to the device (use "-" to send the message without a password).
You can get your key by navigating to the AutoRemote page of your device (p.e.: https://goo.gl/abcde1234), type a message in the textbox and click on the button "Send Message Now!". 
The device key is then shown in the blue textbox (in "Use this url to directly send this message").
